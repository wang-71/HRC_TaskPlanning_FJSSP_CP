This project addresses task planning for humanâ€“robot collaboration (HRC) in structural assembly by formulating the problem as a Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP).
The optimization is solved using Constraint Programming (CP) implemented through Google OR-Tools.

This approach allows for efficient allocation and sequencing of human and robot tasks, improving assembly coordination and productivity while mitigating human fatigue.
